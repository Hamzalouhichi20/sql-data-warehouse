# 📊 SQL Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to the **SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics** project repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates how to build a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server**, following industry best practices in **data architecture**, **ETL design**, and **analytics**.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture — Medallion Approach

The architecture follows the **Medallion pattern**, organizing data into three structured layers to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clarity:

### 🥉 Bronze Layer  
Raw data is ingested **as-is** from CSV files into SQL Server with minimal transformation.

### 🥈 Silver Layer  
Data is **cleaned**, **standardized**, and **joined** across sources to produce an integrated dataset ready for modeling.

### 🥇 Gold Layer  
Business-ready data is **modeled using a star schema** to support analytics, KPIs, and reporting.

## 🔗 Data Integration Model

This model represents how the project unifies and cleanses data from multiple source systems before applying dimensional modeling.

## 🔄 Data Flow Overview

The diagram below illustrates the full ETL pipeline:  
From **raw CSV ingestion** → **cleaned Silver data** → **modeled Gold data**.

## 🌟 Dimensional Model

The project uses a **Star Schema** for the Gold layer, optimizing query performance and simplifying analytical workloads.
