# sql-data-warehouse
Building a modern data warehouse With SQL Server, including ETL process, Data modeling and Analytics
#🏗️ Data Architecture
For this project, I use the Medallion Architecture,it’s simple, scalable, and practical. The Data Warehouse is divided into three layers:
Bronze Layer: Raw data is ingested as-is from CSV files into SQL Server.

Silver Layer: Data is cleaned, standardized, and normalized for analysis.

Gold Layer: Business-ready data is modeled in a star schema for reporting and analytics.
